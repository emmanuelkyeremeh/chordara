# Firestore Rules Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Dashboard Not Showing Tracks Issue

### Problem
The dashboard shows "No tracks yet" even though tracks have been created and exported successfully.

### Root Cause
The Firestore security rules were not properly configured to allow querying the tracks collection.

### Solution

#### 1. Deploy the Fixed Rules
Run the deployment script to update your Firestore rules:

```bash
./deploy-firestore-rules.sh
```

Or manually deploy using Firebase CLI:

```bash
# Login to Firebase (if not already logged in)
firebase login

# Deploy only the Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

#### 2. Verify Rules Deployment
1. Go to your Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Click on "Rules" tab
4. Verify the rules match the updated `firestore.rules` file

#### 3. Test the Dashboard
1. Create a new track in the studio
2. Export it to save to Firestore
3. Navigate to the dashboard
4. Check browser console for detailed logs

### Updated Firestore Rules

The corrected rules now properly handle:
- âœ… User authentication
- âœ… Track creation with proper user ID validation
- âœ… Track reading with user ID filtering
- âœ… Query permissions for listing user tracks

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own tracks
    match /tracks/{trackId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }

    // Users can only access their own user profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging Steps

#### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for these log messages:
- `ðŸ“Š Dashboard: Setting up tracks listener`
- `ðŸ“Š Dashboard: Creating Firestore query`
- `ðŸ“Š Dashboard: Firestore snapshot received: X user tracks`
- `ðŸ“Š Dashboard: User tracks: [array of tracks]`

#### 2. Check Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database
2. Check if tracks exist in the "tracks" collection
3. Verify each track has a `userId` field matching your user ID

#### 3. Check Network Tab
1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Look for Firestore API calls
4. Check for any 403 (Forbidden) errors

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Rules Not Deployed
**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows 0 tracks, console shows 403 errors
**Solution**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

#### Issue 2: Wrong User ID
**Symptoms**: Tracks exist but don't show for current user
**Solution**: Check that `userId` in tracks matches `currentUser.uid`

#### Issue 3: Missing Indexes
**Symptoms**: Query fails with "index not found" error
**Solution**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`

#### Issue 4: Authentication Issues
**Symptoms**: User not authenticated
**Solution**: Check Firebase Auth configuration and user login status

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Check Firebase CLI status
firebase projects:list

# Check current project
firebase use

# Deploy rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# View logs
firebase functions:log
```

### Prevention

1. **Always deploy rules after changes**
2. **Test in Firebase Console Rules Playground**
3. **Use proper error handling in queries**
4. **Add comprehensive logging for debugging**

### Success Indicators

âœ… Dashboard loads without errors
âœ… Console shows "X user tracks" in logs
âœ… Tracks appear in dashboard grid
âœ… No 403 errors in Network tab
âœ… Firestore rules show as deployed in console
